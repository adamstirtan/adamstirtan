### Hey, friends! 👋

I'm [Adam Stirtan](https://adamstirtan.notion.site/adamstirtan/Adam-Stirtan-s-Blog-e3066ed9611f44c2887403ff3680af7d). I'm a software engineer, husband and dad. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Right now I'm working at [@paper-co](https://github.com/paper-co) as a manager of software development. My teams are focused on math education and writing feedback and review. In my spare time I love being with my family, watching basketball, playing guitar, reading and going places I haven't been before. I write about computer science, parenting and life on my blog at https://www.adamstirtan.com.
