### Hey, friends! 👋

I'm [Adam Stirtan](https://www.adamstirtan.com). I'm a programmer, blogger, husband and dad. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

By day, I build HR software. By night, I enjoy hacking on various .NET projects, Xbox and family time.

At my site, [adamstirtan.com](https://www.adamstirtan.com), I post about all the things I find throughout the day. It's my landing page of life. I'm driven by the mindset that if you aren't learning, you aren't growing.
